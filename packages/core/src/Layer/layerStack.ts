/**
 * @file layerStack.ts
 * @input Uses the isImeKeyEvent predicate
 * @output Exports the shared layer dismissal stack: registration, top-most
 *   ordering, and the single document-level Escape listener
 * @position Internal to the Layer system; consumed by useLayerDismissal, which
 *   is what overlays actually call. Not exported from the package root.
 *
 * SYNC: When modified, update:
 * - /packages/core/src/Layer/useLayerDismissal.ts
 * - /packages/core/src/Layer/useLayerDismissal.test.tsx
 *
 * ## Why one stack
 *
 * Every overlay used to own its own Escape listener, so one press dismissed
 * every open layer (a popover inside a Dialog closed both; a Modal opened from
 * inside another Modal closed both). Patching this per primitive produced
 * parallel registries — the focus-trap Escape stack, Drawer's LIFO registry,
 * useScrollLock's counter. This module is the single registry those collapse
 * into. One press dismisses exactly one layer.
 *
 * ## Only the top layer acts
 *
 * The stack owns ONE `keydown` listener on `document` and routes the press to
 * the top-most layer itself. Overlays do not listen; they register and say what
 * they want done. The alternative — every layer listens and filters itself out
 * — is what forces `stopPropagation()` choreography between element-level and
 * document-level listeners, and it silently breaks whenever a layer forgets.
 *
 * ## Bubble phase, not capture
 *
 * The listener is on the BUBBLE phase so content inside a layer can claim the
 * press first, either by `stopPropagation()` (the press never reaches us) or by
 * `preventDefault()` (we see it and stand down). Editors are the motivating
 * case: Monaco and the rich-text editor use Escape to close their own find
 * widget or autocomplete, and that must win over dismissing the Dialog they sit
 * in. A capture-phase listener would take the press away from them.
 *
 * ## The stack, not the browser, decides
 *
 * When the stack handles a press it calls `preventDefault()`, which suppresses
 * the browser's own close-watcher behavior — both `<dialog>`'s `cancel` event
 * and `popover="auto"` light-dismiss (verified in Chromium; the default action
 * runs after propagation, so a bubble-phase `preventDefault` still beats it).
 * That is deliberate: the native top layer only covers `showModal()` and
 * `popover="auto"`, so relying on it would leave non-modal `show()` drawers,
 * `popover="manual"` layers, and older browsers on a second, differently-behaved
 * code path. One code path, one ordering, everywhere.

/**
 * What a layer does with an Escape press that reaches it.
 *
 * - `'close'` — dismiss this layer and consume the press. One Escape closes
 *   exactly this layer. The default, and correct for every dismissible layer:
 *   modals, popovers, menus, comboboxes, and hover layers alike.
 * - `'block'` — consume the press WITHOUT dismissing. For a layer that requires
 *   an explicit choice (`Dialog purpose="required"`): Escape must not dismiss
 *   it, and must not fall through and dismiss something behind it either.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "dismiss but let the press continue" variant. Escape
 * affects exactly one layer, always — a rule with no per-component exceptions
 * is one users can predict. Hover layers were the tempting exception (the user
 * never opened the tip, so why should it eat their press?), but guessing wrong
 * that way is destructive: someone dismissing a stray tooltip over a form would
 * lose the whole dialog. Guessing wrong the other way costs one keystroke.

/**
 * Order two entries: positive when `a` is above `b`, negative when below.

 *
 * 1. **Depth.** The layer nested inside the other is on top. This is what makes
 *    an inner-and-outer pair that mount in the SAME commit come out right;
 *    registration order alone gets it backwards, because React runs child
 *    effects before parent effects.
 * 2. **DOM containment.** Depth only moves when a layer wraps its content in a
 *    `LayerDepthProvider`, which a bare `useFocusTrap` cannot do — it renders
 *    nothing. For those, containment recovers the nesting the tree did not
 *    report.
 * 3. **Registration order.** For unrelated layers, the one opened later is on
 *    top, matching how the browser's own top layer stacks.
 *
 * Modality is deliberately NOT a key. Ranking modals above everything sounds
 * right and is not: a hover tip shown inside a modal renders on top of it, so
 * a modal-first rule would hand the press to the dialog and strand the tip.
 * Nesting already covers the case modality was meant to catch — a layer opened
 * from inside another is deeper, modal or not.
 *
 * Note this is a PARTIAL order: containment relates only nested pairs. Callers
 * must resolve the top with a pairwise max scan, never `Array.sort`, whose
 * result is undefined for a non-transitive comparator.

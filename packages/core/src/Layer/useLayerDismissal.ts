   * - **The consumer owns the keyboard contract.** A controlled overlay whose
   *   visibility is driven by a prop: the app decides when it closes, and the
   *   system silently closing it would fight the state the app is holding.
   * - **The layer is not really an overlay.** `Dialog`'s inline rendering mode
   *   puts dialog content in normal flow with nothing layered over anything.
   * - **Escape means something else inside it.** A layer hosting an editor or a
   *   nested widget with its own Escape semantics. Prefer letting that content
   *   claim the press (`stopPropagation`/`preventDefault`, which the stack
   *   honors) — opting the whole layer out is the blunt version, and gives up
   *   dismissal even when focus is nowhere near the widget.
   * - **Something else already sequences it.** A layer whose dismissal is
   *   driven by an animation or gesture controller that must run the teardown.
   *
   * Layers that are never Escape-dismissible (toasts) should simply not call
   * this hook.
